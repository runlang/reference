limited to BPDM, BPEL4WS, BPML, BPMN, BPSS, EPML, OWL-S, PNML, UML Activity Diagram, WS-CDL,
WSCI, WSCL, WSFL, XLANG, XPD, XPDL, YAWL</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>In the past few decades, a lot of efforts have been made to formalize workflow
patterns into a language that can be used by non-technical and technical stakeholders
alike in order to maintain a shared understanding of processes, reasoning and decision
making. This has resulted in development and adoption of such languages as BPEL, BPMN, YAWL
and alike.</p><p>In this section, for the purpose of clarity, we&rsquo;ll focus on BPMN as a baseline.
It&rsquo;s a well-established and documented language supported by multiple software vendors.</p><p>There are a few important properties that BPMN has:</p><ul><li><p>Visual language (flow diagrams) that provides a comprehensive, bird&rsquo;s-eye view</p></li><li><p>Execution semantics that allow for a mechanical interpretation (<span style="font-style: italic">execution</span>) of documents</p></li><li><p>Introduction of useful standard workflow primitives such as events, boundary events,
timers, compensations and so on to enable standardized handling of complex cases</p></li></ul><p>BPMN does come with some trade offs:</p><ul><li><blockquote class="refpara"><blockquote class="refcolumn"><blockquote class="refcontent"><p>Examples:</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">Complex Gateway</span>, what does it do?</p><p>What&rsquo;s the difference between a <span style="font-style: italic">signal</span> and a <span style="font-style: italic">message</span>?
How does message delivery differ based on the kind of <span style="font-style: italic">correlation</span> used?</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>The flow elements have their execution semantics defined and one needs to know
to construct the flow in a correct manner. Therefore, it implies the need for
a translation between processes laid out in a natural language to the language
of activation of flow elements according to their execution semantics. So, instead of describing
what <span style="font-style: italic">needs to occur</span>, one needs to model according to what the flow element or their composition
will do. It gets especially challenging when flow element&rsquo;s own naming does not reveal its function.</p></li><li><p>Authoring diagrams is not the most natural user experience. A significant amount
of research needs to be done in order to figure out a truly effective way to author diagrams,
considering the amount of possibilities afforded by the standard. It becomes even more difficult
if the document needs to be executable, as it&rsquo;ll start requiring changes of authoring mode between the diagram,
flow element properties and text-based expressions.</p></li><li><p>Authoring programs (because executable documents are effectively programs) as diagrams is not the most
anticipated approach for most of software engineers and it is not the best fit for their tooling and practices.
While BPMN documents are XML documents and can be edited as text, at that point they become counter-productive
as authoring through long-winded XML formalisms makes it difficult to both write and read them, therefore defying
the core promise of providing understanding and a high-level view.</p></li><li><p>Lack of composition. While almost any workflow can be expressed in BPMN, it can become repetitive if certain
patterns are to occur repeatedly. As an example, we can imagine a case for re-trying an activity with an exponential
backoff, with a maximum number of retries. It&rsquo;s implementable, but copying it around can quickly become a chore and be error-prone.</p></li><li><p>Lack of first-class execution tracing. <span style="font-style: italic">TO BE CONTINUED</span></p></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold">We propose</span> that one can derive benefits from patterns identified in by BPMN
and similar approaches while mitigating the aforementioned trade-offs by introducing a
high level text-based language that focuses on <span style="font-style: italic">what needs to occur</span> as opposed to
connecting flow elements that have their own behavior. It will allow to express complex
behaviours that don&rsquo;t need to be deconstructed through the prism of flow elements&rsquo;
execution semantics.</p><p>The language should be at least somewhat familiar to software engineers to be
accepted as a reasonable tool in their toolbox and play well with established
practices.</p><p>At the same time, the language should bear at least some level of general
readability to avoid it being a complete gibberish for those who aren&rsquo;t software
engineers.</p><p>The language should also retain the high level intent of the authors in order to
be transformable to and from different representations, such as visual diagrams
(as these are indeed very useful for process comprehension).</p><p>This document introduces the <span style="font-weight: bold">Run Language</span> to address this proposition.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Introduction.html" title="backward to &quot;1 Introduction&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Run Language&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Goals.html" title="forward to &quot;3 Goals&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
